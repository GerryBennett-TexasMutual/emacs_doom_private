a number counts as a prefix arg.

If `show-trailing-whitespace' is non-nil, this command will just
delete the rest of the current line, even if there are no nonblanks
there.

If option `kill-whole-line' is non-nil, then this command deletes the whole line
including its terminating newline, when used at the beginning of a line
with no argument.

If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the line."
